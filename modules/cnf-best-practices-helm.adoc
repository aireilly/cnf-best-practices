= Helm v3

Helm v3 is a serverless mechanism for defining templates that describe a complete kubernetes application. This allows a template to be built for an application and site/deployment specific values to be provided as input to the template when being pushed to a cluster such that different configurations can be made in different locations. It is roughly analogous to HEAT templates in the Openstack environment.

Please note that the version of OpenShift will change over time and this link only points to the current version that was in planning at the time this document was last updated.
